I use Power BI and Excel to perform deep analytics, transforming complex data into key insights. I make attractive visualizations that show the important points clearly. I not only analyze the data but also use a strategic method to identify trends, patterns, and useful information. I combine Power BI’s strong features and Excel’s flexibility to deliver analysis that goes beyond the expectations, offering a complete view for smart decision-making.
